# LLM Analysis Feature - Decision Log

## Initial Feature Proposal
**Date**: 2025-01-13  
**Decision**: User requested LLM analysis feature for Terraform plans  
**Context**: User wants AI-powered analysis focusing on business continuity, security, and costs using multiple LLM providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, GitHub, local models)  
**Rationale**: Enhanced insights beyond current deterministic analysis

## Feature Name Selection
**Date**: 2025-01-13  
**Decision**: Proposed feature name "llm-analysis"  
**Context**: Waiting for user confirmation on feature name  
**Rationale**: Descriptive and clearly indicates the AI/LLM integration aspect

## Critical Reviews Completed
**Date**: 2025-01-13  
**Decision**: Conducted design-critic and peer-review-validator reviews  
**Context**: Both reviews raised severe concerns about security, cost, complexity, and fundamental mission alignment  

### Key Concerns Identified:
1. **Security Risks**: Data exfiltration of infrastructure blueprints to external LLM providers
2. **Compliance Issues**: SOC2, GDPR, HIPAA violations from sending sensitive data externally  
3. **Cost Control**: Unpredictable and potentially expensive LLM API usage
4. **Mission Misalignment**: Non-deterministic LLM analysis conflicts with Strata's reliable, deterministic approach
5. **Technical Complexity**: Significant integration challenges with existing architecture
6. **Value Proposition**: Questionable benefits vs. substantial risks and complexity

### Alternative Approaches Suggested:
- Policy as Code integration (OPA)
- Enhanced deterministic heuristics
- Custom danger highlight configuration
- Improved visualization of existing analysis

## Pending User Response
**Status**: Awaiting user feedback on requirements and critical review findings  
**Next Steps**: User needs to address security concerns and confirm whether to proceed despite identified risks

## Feature Decision - Postponed
**Date**: 2025-01-14  
**Decision**: Feature development postponed  
**Context**: After reviewing the critical security, compliance, cost, and architectural concerns raised by both reviewers, the user has decided to postpone this feature for future consideration  
**Rationale**: The identified risks and complexity outweigh the potential benefits at this time. May be reconsidered in the future with different approach or constraints  
**Status**: Feature requirements and analysis preserved for potential future reference
