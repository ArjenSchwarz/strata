# LLM Analysis Feature Requirements

## Introduction

The LLM Analysis feature adds AI-powered analysis capabilities to Strata's Terraform plan summaries. This feature enables users to leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) to provide intelligent insights about the business impact, security implications, and cost considerations of proposed infrastructure changes. The analysis focuses solely on the Terraform plan output and provides actionable insights to help teams make informed decisions about their infrastructure deployments.

## Requirements

### 1. LLM Provider Support
**User Story**: As a DevOps engineer, I want to configure multiple LLM providers so that I can choose the most appropriate AI service for my organization's needs and constraints.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. The system SHALL support OpenAI and OpenAI-compatible APIs
2. The system SHALL support Anthropic's Claude API
3. The system SHALL support GitHub's LLM capabilities (GitHub Copilot/Models)
4. The system SHALL support locally running models via compatible APIs
5. The system SHALL allow configuration of custom API endpoints for compatible providers
6. The system SHALL validate API keys and connectivity before attempting analysis
7. The system SHALL handle provider-specific authentication methods securely

### 2. Analysis Configuration
**User Story**: As a platform administrator, I want to configure LLM analysis settings so that I can control when and how AI analysis is performed across my organization.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. The system SHALL disable LLM analysis by default
2. The system SHALL provide a configuration option to enable LLM analysis globally
3. The system SHALL provide a command-line flag to enable/disable LLM analysis per execution
4. The system SHALL allow configuration of which LLM provider to use
5. The system SHALL allow configuration of model-specific parameters (temperature, max tokens, etc.)
6. The system SHALL provide timeout configuration for LLM API calls
7. The system SHALL allow configuration of retry policies for failed API calls

### 3. Analysis Content and Focus
**User Story**: As a DevOps engineer, I want AI-powered insights about my Terraform plan so that I can understand the business impact of proposed changes before applying them.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. The system SHALL analyze only the Terraform plan output, not source code
2. The system SHALL focus analysis on business continuity impacts
3. The system SHALL focus analysis on security implications
4. The system SHALL focus analysis on cost considerations
5. The system SHALL provide a concise summary suitable for non-technical stakeholders
6. The system SHALL identify high-risk changes that may affect production systems
7. The system SHALL highlight potential compliance or governance concerns

### 4. Output Integration
**User Story**: As a DevOps engineer, I want LLM analysis results integrated into the plan summary so that I can see all information in one place.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. The system SHALL display LLM analysis as part of the standard plan summary
2. The system SHALL clearly distinguish LLM-generated content from standard analysis
3. The system SHALL maintain consistent formatting across all output formats (table, JSON, HTML, Markdown)
4. The system SHALL provide collapsible sections for LLM analysis in supported formats
5. The system SHALL include analysis timestamp and provider information
6. The system SHALL handle cases where LLM analysis fails gracefully without breaking the summary

### 5. GitHub Action Integration
**User Story**: As a CI/CD administrator, I want to control LLM analysis in GitHub Actions so that I can enable AI insights for specific workflows or repositories.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. The system SHALL provide a separate GitHub Action input flag for enabling LLM analysis
2. The system SHALL support GitHub Action secrets for API key management
3. The system SHALL include LLM analysis in PR comments when enabled
4. The system SHALL respect rate limits and quotas for LLM providers in CI/CD contexts
5. The system SHALL provide clear error messages when LLM analysis fails in Actions
6. The system SHALL allow configuration of LLM provider and model in GitHub Action inputs

### 6. Security and Privacy
**User Story**: As a security administrator, I want LLM analysis to handle sensitive information securely so that infrastructure details are not inadvertently exposed.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. The system SHALL never log API keys or sensitive authentication information
2. The system SHALL provide options to sanitize sensitive data before sending to LLM providers
3. The system SHALL support on-premises/local LLM deployment for air-gapped environments
4. The system SHALL provide clear documentation about data handling and privacy implications
5. The system SHALL allow users to review what data will be sent to external providers
6. The system SHALL implement secure credential storage and retrieval mechanisms

### 7. Error Handling and Reliability
**User Story**: As a DevOps engineer, I want LLM analysis failures to not break my workflow so that I can still get standard plan summaries even when AI services are unavailable.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. The system SHALL continue normal operation when LLM services are unavailable
2. The system SHALL provide clear error messages for LLM analysis failures
3. The system SHALL implement appropriate retry logic for transient failures
4. The system SHALL respect rate limits and implement backoff strategies
5. The system SHALL timeout LLM requests to prevent hanging operations
6. The system SHALL log LLM analysis errors for troubleshooting without exposing sensitive data

### 8. Performance and Efficiency
**User Story**: As a DevOps engineer, I want LLM analysis to complete efficiently so that it doesn't significantly slow down my deployment pipeline.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. The system SHALL complete LLM analysis within configurable time limits
2. The system SHALL optimize plan data sent to LLMs to minimize token usage and costs
3. The system SHALL cache analysis results when appropriate to avoid redundant API calls
4. The system SHALL provide progress indicators for long-running analysis operations
5. The system SHALL allow users to configure analysis depth vs. speed trade-offs
