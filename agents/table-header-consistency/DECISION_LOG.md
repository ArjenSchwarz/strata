# Table Header Consistency Feature - Decision Log

## Decisions Made

### D001: Title Case Standardization (2025-08-04)
**Decision**: All table headers will use Title Case formatting (e.g., "Property Changes", "High Risk")
**Rationale**: Title Case provides optimal balance for CLI tool because it's professional, readable in terminal environments, follows standard UI conventions, and works well across all output formats
**Status**: Approved

### D002: Preserve Correct Word Capitalization (2025-08-04)
**Decision**: Technical terms and abbreviations will maintain their correct capitalization (e.g., "ID" remains "ID", not "Id")
**Rationale**: Maintains technical accuracy and follows established conventions for abbreviations
**Status**: Approved

### D003: Simple Implementation Approach (2025-08-04)
**Decision**: Make direct changes to titles without implementing consistency enforcement systems
**Rationale**: "Let's not overcomplicate things. At this stage all we really need to do is change the titles to be Title Case. We don't need any systems to keep this consistent."
**Status**: Approved

### D004: Comprehensive Table Coverage (2025-08-04)
**Decision**: All tables should use the same header format, including provider-grouped tables and any additional tables
**Rationale**: Complete consistency across all table outputs improves user experience
**Status**: Approved

### D005: No Display Name Feature Required (2025-08-04)
**Decision**: Since go-output v2 doesn't have display name support, we need to change how the code works to achieve the desired effect
**Rationale**: Based on analysis of go-output v2 API documentation which shows no current implementation for display names
**Status**: Approved

### D006: Priority Justification (2025-08-04)
**Decision**: Header consistency is important enough to warrant implementation now
**Rationale**: User explicitly confirmed "the change is important enough that I'm asking for it"
**Status**: Approved

### D007: No Accessibility Considerations Currently (2025-08-04)
**Decision**: No special accessibility considerations will be implemented at this time
**Rationale**: "Nothing taken into account for accessibility, but it's good enough for now"
**Status**: Approved

### D008: Table Format Headers Limitation (2025-08-04)
**Decision**: Accept that table format headers will always display in ALL UPPERCASE and cannot be changed
**Rationale**: "The table format headers format is fixed and will always be ALL UPPERCASE. Exclude requirement 6.1 for this reason as we cannot change that but have to accept it."
**Status**: Approved

### D009: No Backwards Compatibility Required (2025-08-05)
**Decision**: Proceed with direct field name changes without backwards compatibility considerations
**Rationale**: JSON API is not in use and there are no downstream tools or consumers that would be affected by changing field names. This confirms that the simple implementation approach (D003) can be safely implemented without breaking change concerns.
**Status**: Approved
