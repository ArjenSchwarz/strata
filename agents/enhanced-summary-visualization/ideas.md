# Enhanced Summary Visualization - Future Ideas

This document contains ideas and features that were considered but deferred for future implementation.

## Risk Mitigation Enhancements

These items were originally part of requirement 3.6 but have been moved to future consideration:

### Detailed Risk Analysis Content
- **Potential impact assessment** - Analyze and display potential impacts like data loss, downtime, and security implications
- **Recommended mitigation steps** - Provide specific actionable steps to mitigate identified risks
- **Alternative approaches** - Suggest safer deployment strategies for high-risk changes

### Implementation Considerations
The risk mitigation piece requires additional design work to determine:
- How to generate meaningful mitigation suggestions for different resource types
- What alternative deployment strategies to recommend
- How to assess potential impacts accurately
- Integration with external risk assessment tools or databases

These features would enhance the risk analysis capabilities but require more detailed design and potentially external data sources to implement effectively.

## Other Future Ideas

- Interactive mode with expand/collapse controls in terminal
- Custom grouping rules beyond provider/service
- Advanced property change visualization with diffs
- Integration with cost estimation tools
- Historical change tracking and comparison
