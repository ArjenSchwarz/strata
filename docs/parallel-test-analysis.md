# Parallel Test Analysis for Strata

This document explains which tests have been made parallel and which cannot be parallelized, along with the reasoning for each decision.

## Tests Made Parallel

### lib/plan/models_test.go - All Tests ✅
- **TestResourceChange_SerializationWithNewFields** - Pure JSON serialization testing
- **TestFromTerraformAction** - Pure function testing enum conversion  
- **TestChangeType_IsDestructive** - Method testing on types
- **TestResourceAnalysis_Serialization** - Pure JSON serialization testing
- **TestPropertyChange_SensitiveData** - Simple data structure validation

**Reasoning**: These are pure unit tests that only test data structures and methods without any shared state, file operations, or external dependencies.

### config/validation_result_test.go - All Tests ✅
- **TestValidationResult** - Tests data structure methods
- **TestFileOutputError** - Tests error formatting methods

**Reasoning**: Pure unit tests testing data structure behavior with no shared state.

### lib/plan/parser_test.go - Selected Tests ✅
- **TestParser_extractWorkspaceInfo** - Pure function testing data extraction
- **TestParser_extractBackendInfo** - Pure function testing data extraction  
- **TestNewParser** - Simple constructor testing

**Reasoning**: These specific parser tests only test data extraction functions without file I/O operations.

## Tests NOT Made Parallel

### Integration Tests ❌
**Files**: All `*integration_test.go` files
- `lib/plan/integration_test.go`
- `lib/plan/output_refinements_integration_test.go` 
- `lib/plan/output_improvements_integration_test.go`

**Reasoning**: Integration tests load testdata files and test end-to-end workflows, which can have shared resource dependencies.

### File Operation Tests ❌
**Files**: Tests using `filepath.Join` with testdata
- `config/validation_file_test.go` - Creates temporary files
- `config/validation_security_test.go` - File system operations
- `lib/plan/parser_test.go` (some tests) - Load actual plan files
- `lib/plan/error_handling_test.go` - Loads testdata files
- `lib/plan/performance_test.go` - Creates temporary test files

**Reasoning**: These tests create temporary files, read from testdata directory, or perform file system operations that could interfere with each other when run in parallel.

### Global State Tests ❌
**Files**: Tests modifying package-level variables
- `cmd/version_test.go` - All tests modify global `Version`, `BuildTime`, `GitCommit` variables

**Reasoning**: These tests modify shared global state and would have race conditions if run in parallel.

### Configuration Tests ❌  
**Files**: Tests using external configuration systems
- `config/config_test.go` - Uses Viper configuration which may have shared state

**Reasoning**: Viper and other configuration systems may have internal shared state that could cause race conditions.

### Tests with Ordering Dependencies ❌
**Files**: Tests that depend on specific execution order
- Any tests that set up state for other tests to use
- Tests that clean up shared resources

**Reasoning**: Parallel execution could change the order of operations and break test dependencies.

## Summary

- **Total tests made parallel**: 8 test functions across 3 files
- **Parallel safety verified**: All parallel tests pass with `-race` flag
- **Performance improvement**: Tests now utilize multiple CPU cores for faster execution
- **Safety maintained**: Only pure unit tests without shared dependencies were parallelized

## Best Practices Applied

1. **t.Parallel() placement**: Added as first statement in test functions and subtests
2. **Loop variable capture**: Used `tt := tt` pattern for safe variable capture in parallel subtests
3. **Race condition testing**: Verified all parallel tests with `go test -race`
4. **Conservative approach**: Only parallelized tests that are clearly safe, avoiding any questionable cases

This conservative approach ensures that parallel testing provides performance benefits while maintaining test reliability and avoiding any flaky test behavior.
