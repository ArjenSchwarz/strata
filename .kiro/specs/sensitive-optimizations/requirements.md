# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Sensitive Resource Optimization feature aims to enhance the performance and reliability of Strata's sensitive resource filtering functionality. Currently, Strata allows users to define sensitive resources and properties in the configuration file, but there are opportunities to improve performance, add validation, and enhance error messages. This feature will focus on optimizing the filtering process, validating configuration entries, and providing more context in error messages.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a Strata user, I want sensitive resource filtering to be more performant, so that large Terraform plans with many resources can be analyzed quickly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a Terraform plan with more than 100 resources is analyzed THEN the sensitive resource filtering should complete in under 500ms.
2. WHEN the analyzer checks for sensitive resources THEN it should use optimized data structures for faster lookups.
3. WHEN multiple sensitive resources or properties are defined THEN the lookup performance should not degrade linearly with the number of definitions.
4. WHEN the analyzer processes a plan THEN it should minimize redundant checks for sensitive resources and properties.

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a Strata user, I want configuration validation for sensitive resources and properties, so that I can be confident my configuration is correct before running an analysis.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads a configuration file THEN it should validate that sensitive resource types are properly formatted.
2. WHEN the application loads a configuration file THEN it should validate that sensitive property definitions have both resource_type and property fields.
3. WHEN invalid sensitive resource or property configurations are detected THEN the application should return clear error messages.
4. WHEN duplicate sensitive resource or property definitions are found THEN the application should warn the user.
5. WHEN a configuration file is loaded THEN the application should validate that resource types follow a recognized format (e.g., aws_*).

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a Strata user, I want enhanced error messages with more context, so that I can quickly identify and fix issues with my configuration or Terraform plans.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an error occurs during sensitive resource filtering THEN the error message should include the specific resource type that caused the issue.
2. WHEN an error occurs during sensitive property filtering THEN the error message should include both the resource type and property name.
3. WHEN configuration validation fails THEN the error message should specify which part of the configuration is invalid and why.
4. WHEN the application encounters an error parsing a Terraform plan THEN it should provide context about which part of the plan caused the issue.
5. WHEN multiple errors are encountered THEN the application should aggregate them into a comprehensive error report rather than failing on the first error.
