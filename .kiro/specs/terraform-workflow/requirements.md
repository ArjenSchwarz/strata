# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Terraform Workflow feature extends Strata's capabilities beyond just analyzing Terraform plan files to provide a complete workflow that wraps the Terraform plan and apply commands. This feature will allow users to run `strata apply` which will execute the Terraform plan command, display a summary of changes, offer options to view detailed output or proceed with applying the changes, and then execute the Terraform apply command if approved. This approach is inspired by the workflow used in Fog for CloudFormation deployments, providing a more streamlined and user-friendly experience for Terraform users.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a Terraform user, I want to execute the entire plan and apply workflow through a single Strata command, so that I can streamline my infrastructure deployment process.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user runs `strata apply` THEN the system SHALL execute the Terraform plan command
2. WHEN the Terraform plan command completes THEN the system SHALL display a summary of the planned changes using Strata's existing analysis capabilities
3. WHEN the summary is displayed THEN the system SHALL prompt the user with options to apply changes, view detailed output, or cancel
4. WHEN the user chooses to apply changes THEN the system SHALL execute the Terraform apply command
5. WHEN the user chooses to view detailed output THEN the system SHALL display the full Terraform plan output
6. WHEN the user chooses to cancel THEN the system SHALL exit without applying changes
7. WHEN the Terraform apply command completes THEN the system SHALL display a summary of the applied changes

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want to customize the Terraform workflow execution, so that I can adapt it to my specific project requirements and CI/CD pipelines.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user provides command-line flags THEN the system SHALL apply those configurations to the workflow
2. WHEN the user specifies a custom Terraform binary path THEN the system SHALL use that binary for execution
3. WHEN the user provides custom Terraform arguments THEN the system SHALL pass those arguments to the Terraform commands
4. WHEN the user enables non-interactive mode THEN the system SHALL automatically approve and apply changes without prompting
5. WHEN the user specifies a custom working directory THEN the system SHALL execute Terraform commands in that directory
6. WHEN the user provides a configuration file THEN the system SHALL use those settings for the workflow

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a security-conscious user, I want to be clearly informed about potentially destructive changes before applying them, so that I can prevent accidental infrastructure damage.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the plan includes destructive changes THEN the system SHALL highlight these changes prominently in the summary
2. WHEN the danger threshold is exceeded THEN the system SHALL display a warning message
3. WHEN the user has configured a danger threshold THEN the system SHALL use that threshold for warnings
4. WHEN destructive changes are detected THEN the system SHALL require explicit confirmation before proceeding with apply
5. WHEN in non-interactive mode with destructive changes THEN the system SHALL respect the `--force` flag to determine whether to proceed

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a team member, I want to see real-time progress and results of the Terraform operations, so that I can monitor the deployment process effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN executing Terraform commands THEN the system SHALL stream the output in real-time to the console
2. WHEN the Terraform plan or apply command is running THEN the system SHALL display progress indicators
3. WHEN the Terraform command completes THEN the system SHALL clearly indicate success or failure
4. WHEN the Terraform apply command fails THEN the system SHALL display detailed error information
5. WHEN the workflow completes THEN the system SHALL provide a summary of the entire operation

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a CI/CD pipeline operator, I want to integrate the Strata Terraform workflow into automated processes, so that I can use it in continuous deployment pipelines.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running in a CI/CD environment THEN the system SHALL detect this and adjust output formatting appropriately
2. WHEN the `--non-interactive` flag is used THEN the system SHALL not prompt for user input
3. WHEN the `--output` flag specifies a machine-readable format THEN the system SHALL produce output in that format
4. WHEN exit codes are needed for pipeline decisions THEN the system SHALL return appropriate exit codes based on operation results
5. WHEN running in CI/CD mode THEN the system SHALL provide detailed logging for audit trails
