# GitHub Action File Output Integration Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document specifies the requirements for enhancing the existing Strata GitHub Action to leverage the new dual-output file system. The enhancement will optimize the action to use different output formats for display (stdout) and file operations (PR comments, step summaries), providing better user experience and more appropriate formatting for each context.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer using the Strata GitHub Action, I want the action to display results in an optimal format for terminal viewing while generating markdown-formatted content for GitHub features, so that I get the best experience in both contexts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the action runs THEN it SHALL use table format for stdout display by default
2. WHEN the action generates PR comments THEN it SHALL use markdown format for optimal GitHub rendering
3. WHEN the action writes to step summary THEN it SHALL use markdown format for rich GitHub display
4. WHEN the action processes output THEN it SHALL leverage the dual-output file system to generate both formats efficiently
5. WHEN the user specifies an output format THEN it SHALL only affect the stdout display, not the file outputs

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the action to generate optimized content for different GitHub contexts, so that PR comments and step summaries are more readable and useful.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating PR comments THEN the action SHALL use markdown format with GitHub-specific enhancements
2. WHEN writing to step summary THEN the action SHALL use markdown format with collapsible sections
3. WHEN creating file outputs THEN the action SHALL use appropriate formatting for each destination
4. WHEN the same data needs multiple formats THEN the action SHALL generate them efficiently using the dual-output system

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the action to handle file output operations robustly, so that temporary file issues don't break my CI/CD pipeline.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN file operations fail THEN the action SHALL continue with stdout-only output and log warnings
2. WHEN temporary files are created THEN they SHALL be properly cleaned up after use
3. WHEN file permissions are insufficient THEN the action SHALL provide clear error messages
4. WHEN disk space is limited THEN the action SHALL handle write failures gracefully

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the action to provide clear feedback about what formats are being used, so that I can understand and troubleshoot the output generation process.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the action runs THEN it SHALL log which formats are being used for stdout and file outputs
2. WHEN format conversion occurs THEN the action SHALL indicate what transformations are happening
3. WHEN file output is disabled THEN the action SHALL clearly indicate this in the logs
4. WHEN errors occur THEN the action SHALL provide context about which output operation failed
