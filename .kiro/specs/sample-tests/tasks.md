# Implementation Plan

- [ ] 1. Create samples directory structure
  - Create a dedicated directory for sample test files
  - _Requirements: 1.1_

- [ ] 2. Move sample files to samples directory
  - [ ] 2.1 Move danger-sample.json to samples directory
    - Copy the file content to the new location
    - _Requirements: 1.1_
  
  - [ ] 2.2 Move k8ssample.json to samples directory
    - Copy the file content to the new location
    - _Requirements: 1.1_
  
  - [ ] 2.3 Move websample.json to samples directory
    - Copy the file content to the new location
    - _Requirements: 1.1_

- [ ] 3. Create Makefile with standard targets
  - [ ] 3.1 Implement build target
    - Add 'build' target that runs 'go build .'
    - _Requirements: 2.1_
  
  - [ ] 3.2 Implement test target
    - Add 'test' target that runs 'go test ./...'
    - _Requirements: 2.2_
  
  - [ ] 3.3 Implement run-sample target
    - Add 'run-sample' target that executes a sample file with the plan summary command
    - Include parameter validation to check if the sample file exists
    - _Requirements: 2.3_
  
  - [ ] 3.4 Implement run-sample-verbose target
    - Add 'run-sample-verbose' target that executes a sample with verbose output
    - Include parameter validation to check if the sample file exists
    - _Requirements: 2.4_
  
  - [ ] 3.5 Implement run-sample-debug target
    - Add 'run-sample-debug' target that executes a sample with verbose and debug output
    - Include parameter validation to check if the sample file exists
    - _Requirements: 2.5_

- [ ] 4. Update references to sample files

    - _Requirements: 1.1_
  
  - [ ] 4.2 Update documentation references to sample files
    - Identify and update any documentation that references the sample files
    - _Requirements: 1.1_

- [ ] 5. Write tests for Makefile targets
  - [ ] 5.1 Create test script for Makefile targets
    - Write a script to verify that all Makefile targets work as expected
