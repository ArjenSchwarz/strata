# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature adds version information display functionality to the Strata CLI tool. Users need to be able to check the version of the Strata tool they are using for troubleshooting, compatibility verification, and general information purposes. This is a standard CLI feature that should be available through both a `--version` flag and a dedicated `version` subcommand.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user of the Strata CLI tool, I want to check the version of the tool I'm using, so that I can verify compatibility, report issues accurately, and ensure I'm using the expected version.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user runs `strata --version` THEN the system SHALL display the current version number and exit successfully
2. WHEN a user runs `strata version` THEN the system SHALL display the current version number and exit successfully
3. WHEN the version is displayed THEN the system SHALL show the version in a clear, standard format (e.g., "strata version 1.2.3")
4. WHEN the version flag is used with other commands THEN the system SHALL display the version and ignore other commands/flags
5. WHEN the version is displayed THEN the system SHALL exit with status code 0

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the Strata tool, I want the version information to be automatically managed during the build process, so that releases have accurate version information without manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application is built THEN the system SHALL embed version information at build time
2. WHEN no version is provided during build THEN the system SHALL display a development version indicator (e.g., "dev" or "unknown")
3. WHEN version information is embedded THEN the system SHALL support standard Go build practices using ldflags
4. IF the version is set via build flags THEN the system SHALL use that version for display

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user running Strata in CI/CD pipelines or scripts, I want the version command to provide machine-readable output options, so that I can programmatically check and validate versions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user runs `strata version --output json` THEN the system SHALL display version information in JSON format
2. WHEN JSON output is requested THEN the system SHALL include version number, build information, and Go version
3. WHEN standard output is used THEN the system SHALL display human-readable version information
4. WHEN version information is displayed THEN the system SHALL be consistent with the application's other output formatting patterns
